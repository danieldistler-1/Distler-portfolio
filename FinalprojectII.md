# Final Project Part II 


## Data Cleaning and Preparation. 
To begin completing part II of this project, I knew I would have to spend some time working with the public data set I had collected for Part I. The dataset I chose to focus on included several years of attendance, primary school enrollment, college enrollment, and test score data for Detroit Public Schools Community District. Each file had thousands of observations that looked at each metric for each school, across a variety of subgroups. To parse through this data, I used python to organize, filter and manipulate the data in order to create smaller datasets that I could use to generate each visualization in my final project. 

The link to my python script used to clean and process the data can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10QGvRCpJ8KTT3Vp0la1zAYu1mPpHneyt/view?usp=sharing). 

## Wireframes and Storyboards

Since, uncovering trends would require sifting through a significant amount of data, I ultimately decided to make my draft visualizations using Flourish. I began the process of drafting digital version of the sketches I had included in part I in a digital form using the actual data I had generated from part 1. Over the course of generating these visualizations, there were several instances where I decided to pivot from the original visualization I had planned to use in my outline from Project Part I. In particular, I pivoted from the Bar Chart Race and Tree Maps visualizations I had originally proposed, to simpler comparative bar graphs that would not rely on cumulative metrics. 

As I was completing this higher-fidelity draft visualizations on Flourish, I also began to craft the outline of my broader story. The order and organization of these storyboards were based heavily on the outline I generated in part I of the final project. To create my storyboard, I opted to generate a Shorthand presentation, that would serve as an outline of the project’s final version. I integrated my Flourish visualizations into my drafted Shorthand Presentation and used this as the outline to conduct my user research.  A preview version of this shorthand presentation, can be found [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/8ermEGrhLWoAETCn). 

Note this version of the shorthand outlines the general flow of my presentation. The text and images for each section are drafted versions that will serve as guides and placeholders for the final written description. I will flesh out and clean up these descriptions and text when creating my final version. In conducting my user research using this drafted version of the shorthand, I made sure to preface my interviews by explaining that the shorthand presentation was only a draft of the final project.  

## User Research Protocol:

Identifying my target audience

My project focused on analyzing in depth data on Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD). As a result of this focus, I think there would primarily be two target audiences for this presentation. 

**1. Current and Former Educators and Teachers (Especially in DPSCD)**

Education professionals within DPSCD and beyond are the primary participants in the district. As a result, these professionals would have the greatest stake in the district and schools performance. In my time teaching 6th grade in DPSCD, I often felt bogged down by the weight and difficulty of simply teaching everyday. In these moments, it was easy to lose sight of bigger picture goals that are best assessed at the district level. I am aiming my project at teachers, who are intimately familiar with the education system, and perhaps even DPSCD specifically, to help give a sense of the bigger picture of DPSCD’s progress. In particular, I hope to gain insights about model schools within the district that can help these teachers and educators improve outcomes in their own classrooms. 


**2. Interested Residents and Community Members in Southeast Michigan**

I also think that my project will be useful for and interesting too, residents and community members in Detroit and more broadly in Southeast Michigan. Detroit is the economic hub of this part of the state. Much has been written about Detroit and the city’s fall has also had a major impact on the surrounding community. Detroit’s public school system has been a particularly maligned part of the city’s recent struggles. Therefore, I believe that many community members in Southeast Michigan will also benefit from reading about the school’s progress. Additionally, the resources included in the call to action, while originally aimed at teachers, will also help educate members of the Detroit community and should hopefully further engage them with the city’s  and DPSCD’s revitalization efforts. 

## Finding Representative Interviews

Luckily, as a result of living in Detroit and teaching in DPSCD, many individuals, who are current and former educators and community members have become some of my good friends. Since the project primarily focuses on teachers and educators, I reached out to three of my former colleagues and friends, who have worked in DPSCD or the education field more broadly. Additionally, in an attempt to make sure the message was appealing to a broader audience I also contacted an associate who I knew was an active community member in Wayne County. I asked them all to schedule zoom meetings with me, and presented the preview version of shorthand, included [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/8ermEGrhLWoAETCn) once again,  by sharing my screen and then asked them a series of questions following the script below. 

## Interview Script:
To conduct my user research, I followed the script transcribed below:

Hello and thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. I am going to share, a website with you on my screen. As you look over each section, let me know when you are ready and I can scroll down. This presentation is simply an outline so feel free to only briefly focus on the text and images as these are primarily placeholders. Instead focus most of your attention on the organization of content and the visualizations (charts) for each section. Does that sound okay to you? 

Interview Questions read after above: 

What is the point of this project?

What do the visualizations tell you?

Did you learn any new information from this site?

Is there anything that confuses you?

Is there anything else you would want to see or other information you’d like to find? 

As a teacher/community member what resources and information would you be interested in learning more about?

Is the style of the presentation/graphics interesting/intriguing? Does it make you want to learn more? Did you find the presentation engaging?

## Interview Findings

In compiling this section I used the spreadsheet, linked above, to compare answers for each question and identify trends. For each question below, I offer a general summary of the responses I received and a particularly interesting quote for one or more of my subjects that I plan to use in crafting my final version of the project. 



**What is the point of this project?**

**General Response:** 
It seemed like most of my interviewees seemed to understand the general point of the project. Many mentioned the model schools, and DPSCD’s growth, two central themes I hoped to drive home. However, only two of the respondents noted that the project contained actionable lessons that could be implemented from these schools.  

**Stand Out- Quotes:** 
A 25 year old Southeast Michigan resident I interviewed noted: 
“It seems like there are some model schools in Detroit that are doing really well that the rest of the district might do well to learn from them.”

**What do the visualizations tell you?**

**General Response:** Answers varied, as I asked this question for each individual visualization. Most respondents seemed to generally understand that the visualizations progressed from identifying model schools to honing in on their characteristics. Some lessons users pulled included strong performing schools in terms of attendance and test scores, and the relationship between attendance and graduation. 
 
**Stand Out- Quotes:** 
Male 20s Former DPSCD Teacher
“Top performances seem to excel at all things. There is a correlation between attendance and graduation rates/ college enrollment”

Female 60s Experienced Educator 
“There are model schools that doing things well and succeeding, they should be exemplars we should find out how and how to duplicate it”

**Did you learn any new information from this site?**

**General Response:** Again responses ranged here, the teachers I interviewed seem to have some sense of the data but didn’t have a holistic sense of the overall responses. Those outside of DSPCD seemed surprised at the data available for DPSCD. 

**Stand Out - Quotes:**

Female 20s Former DPSCD Teacher
“I knew some of the data points, particularly at my own schools, Frederick Douglass Academy but had not seen the data fully aggregated in this way. I also thought it was interesting that students with disabilities seem to still do well, but even at model schools do not perform as well as their peers.”

Male 20s Former DPSCD Teacher
“I know alot about DPSCD as a whole but did not have the chance to view this data all in one. It helped me contextualize, my former schools performance. “

**Is there anything that confuses you?**

**General Response:** I was surprised by some of the responses to this question. As there seemed to be a real mix. Some common themes were labeling in graphs, particularly around which schools were Application Schools and Public Schools, within the model schools I identified. Clarity in terms of the metrics and titles were another trouble spot. 

**Stand Out Quotes:**

Male 20s Former DPSCD Teacher
“Two bars in supporting all students graph. Why do you need two? Just include one?”

Female 20s Former DPSCD Teacher 
“Some of the labels in the data are confusing. Is this data only for DPSCD schools or all of Michigan? Particularly in the graphic that includes state averages and district averages it seems confusing to include these in the same way as individual schools.”

**Is there anything else you would want to see or other information you’d like to find?** 

**General Response:**
The biggest common theme was the desire to have points of comparison. While I included the state and district averages in some graphs, multiple users suggested including these points of comparison for context in more of my visualizations. 

**Stand Out Quotes:**
Male 20s Former DPSCD Teacher 
“District Averages, with equivalent % economically disadvantaged this would help contextualize the points made by the model school and underscore how they are different from the other schools in the district”


**As a teacher/community member what resources and information would you be interested in learning more about?**

**General Response:**
Two general trends emerged in response to this question. First, there was a desire for more resources on supporting students. The teachers I interviewed mentioned a desire for more information on supporting students with disabilities and credit recovery opportunities. Secondly, another trend was a desire to understand more about the reasons model schools succeed. 

**Stand Out Quotes:**
Female 20s Wayne County Community Member:
“How can they emulate these strengths, in other schools/programs? What programs and initiatives work, where is there promise?”

Female 20s Former DPSCD Educator
“I would be very interested in opportunities for resources for supporting students with disabilities. I know you have sections that plan to show these resources but I think they should be highlighted more.” 

Male 20s Former DPSCD Educator
“As a High School teacher, I was always very interested in learning about Credit recovery opportunities. I found that my students often entered my class behind and having failed other classes. To make progress on some of the metrics identified in this project difficult, I think credit recovery oppourtunities could be a powerful pathway. I would love to see that spotlighted in some of your call to action steps. I would also like to learn more abou the district's approach to dealing with this task.”

**Is the style of the presentation/graphics interesting intriguing does it make you want to learn more? Did you find the presentation engaging?**

**General Response:**
Most respondents seemed to find the presentation engaging and thoughts the graphics were interactive and made them want to learn more. Several again pointed out that clearer labels and more subtle design choices would help them to more fully engage with the content of the presentation. 

**Stand Out Quote:**
Female 20s Wayne County Community Member
“Really like graphics in beginning and charts recognize DPSCD colors and see good brand continuity. Think the background colors seem a little random, changing them in the written section seems unclear. Maybe less distracting to have plain blue/gray background.”


## Next Steps

After reviewing the results of my user research a few key areas emerged as important next steps. 

**1. Clarity in Metrics**
One key takeaway from my user research was that even for an educated audience of teachers, my metrics and labels were confusing. In creating the final version of my project, I want to be sure to pay close attention to my labels, titles and descriptions that I included on my graphs. I want to ensure these labels and metrics are easily interpretable and contribute to my audience’s ability to quickly understand each graph, rather than hinder their interpretation. 

**Example of Actionable Change:**

In the original version, I used a color distinction to distinguish between Public Schools that were models and application schools that were model schools. After reflection and user research, I realized this wasn’t really relevant to the point I was trying to make and made the graph harder to understand. I also failed to edit the axis labels to be more interpretable, and left them as the column headers in my data set. This made the graph harder to interpret. 

![Original Version](Change%201.JPG)

In my new version, I included only one color for model schools, clearer axis labels and a subtitle that more directly told the story of the data. 
I will repeat this same process for all of my visualizations in order to ensure that they are accessible and clear to my reader. 

![New Version](Change1b.jpg)

**2. Adding baselines for context and comparison** 
Another throughline from my user research, was a desire for more context in some of the metrics I presented. While I included baseline metrics, state and district averages, in some of my graphs, my users expressed a desire to see these points of comparison in more contexts. I believe that including a baseline will help strengthen my case and make my graphs easier to understand. 

**Example of actionable change:**

In the visualization I showed as part of my storyboard, I included bars for each model school, but no point of comparison for the district as a whole. 




In considering this action step, I decided to present the data a bit differently. I not only presented a district average, but also computed averages for only the model schools, since I realized this difference, model schools vs all schools, was more important than the individual averages of the schools themselves. This graph allows the reader to much more clearly see the point. This graph more clearly shows that even though model schools have a higher share of students who are economically disadvantaged than the average DPSCD school, they still have exceptional outcomes. 







**3. Building a broader and more useful base of resources**
Finally, I want this project to serve as a useful set of resources for educators, and community members. To do this I know I will need to expand the set of resources, I present as part of my call to action. This was another common thread that emerged from my user research, as the educators I talked to desired some additional resources particularly around students with disabilities and credit recovery opportunities. Over the course of this week, I plan to expand this section of my project to include a comprehensive set of resources that teachers can actually use. 


**Example of changes:**
After some introductory research here are a few concrete resources I plan to include in my final product.
