# Visualization Choice 

I chose to redesign the cumulative data visualization on [Carnegie Mellon University's COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/dashboard.html)<sup>1</sup>.    I chose to redeisgn this visualization because I have used the dashboard throughout this and last semester to monitor COVID-19 on campus. I found that the existing graphs were often hard to intepret and thought there was room for improvement. For example, this is how the graph originally appears on my computer.

I believe that while the graph communicates its intended message, it could be redesigned to be more aesthetically pleasing and immediately accessible. Link below
