# Visualization Choice 

I chose to redesign the cumulative data visualization on [Carnegie Mellon University's COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/dashboard.html)<sup>1</sup>.    I chose to redeisgn this visualization because I have used the dashboard throughout this and last semester to monitor COVID-19 on campus. I found that the existing graphs were often hard to intepret and thought there was room for improvement. For example, this is how the graph originally appears on my computer.

As you can see above, the graph axis is cut off, while much of the screen is dominated by four large colored squares that make up the graph's legend. Even when zoomed out, as shown below, I believe that graph could be redesigned to be more aesthetically pleasing, and easier to intepret.

# Critique Method 
By completing the critique method, I noticed several aspects of the chart had room for potential improvement. These elements included:

**The Striking Legend:** the four big colored blocks in the graph were the first thing that caught my eye. I wanted to find a different way to label groups in my redesign.

**Four Bright Colors:** I felt the four bright colors used in the graphic were distracting and obfuscated the graph's message. In my final project, I endeavored to be more intentional about color choice. This could help me limit the number of colors and use them to show more trends across groups. 

**Trends over time:** I felt that by using a stacked bar graph to represent the data, the original chart, didn't allow the reader to assess trends within groups over time. I wanted my redesign to allow for this sort of trend detection.
