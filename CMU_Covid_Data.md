# Visualization Choice 

I chose to redesign the cumulative data visualization on [Carnegie Mellon University's COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/dashboard.html)<sup>1</sup>.    I chose to redeisgn this visualization because I have used the dashboard throughout this and last semester to monitor COVID-19 on campus. I found that the existing graphs were often hard to intepret and thought there was room for improvement. For example, this is how the graph originally appears on my computer.

As you can see above, the graph axis is cut off, while much of the screen is dominated by four large colored squares that make up the graph's legend. Even when zoomed out, as shown below, I believe that graph could be redesigned to be more aesthetically pleasing, and easier to intepret.
