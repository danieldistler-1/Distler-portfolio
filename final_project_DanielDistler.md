# Final Project Outline 

## Summary 
For my final project, I want to use data analysis and visualization to understand the performance of schools in Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD). I will focus on using publicly available District and State data to identify common attributes of successful schools in the district and help identify high-performing model schools in the district. 

## Context: Why DPSCD?
DPSCD is the largest district in the state of Michigan with over [50,000 students](https://www.mischooldata.org/student-enrollment-counts-report/). The District peaked in the 1960's with over [300,000 students](https://landgrid.com/reports/schools#credits) but has consistently seen descreasing funding, achievement and enrollment. This cultimated in 2009, when after the financial criss, the district was placed under state-appointed emergency management. While the district has been the subject of a myriad of reporting and visualization, much of this work has focused on the district's [spectacular fall](https://landgrid.com/reports/schools#credits) and detailed the depths of the districts failure. However, the district, along with the city of Detroit more generally, has made significant economic, and academic progress in teh past few years. I want to use this project to help tell this part of the story. I will use [publicly available data](https://www.detroitk12.org/Page/9634) to tell the story of DPSCD schools that are suceeding and have been part of the positive change in the city. 

This story is particularly important, for me, because after graduating college, I spent two years teaching 6th Grade English at a DPSCD school.  While there, I saw the positive work that has taken place in the District under new superintendent [Dr. Vitti](https://www.detroitk12.org/superintendent). Dr. Vitti recently annoucned a [new strategic plan](https://www.detroitk12.org/cms/lib/MI50000060/Centricity/Domain/4036/Blueprint_2020_Strategies_Only.pdf) for the district's future. A major component of the plan involves identifying the model schools that the District can replicate across the city. This project will attempt to use the publicly available data to identify these such schools and the attributes they have in common. 

## Project Structure and Sketches
The following provides an overview of the various sections and visualizations that I anticipate including in my final project, to tell the story defined above. These sections and visualizations, are crudely hand drawn (to the best of my ability), and reflect my expectations of what the data will look like, rather than the data itself. 

### Identifying High-Performing Schools 

The first section will focus on identifying these model schools. I will use data on a number of positive indicators to identify which schools are the highest performing. Some visualizations, I plan to include to help identify these schools are:

## The Data 
The data used from this project is aggregated from the [DPSCD open data files website](https://www.detroitk12.org/Page/9634). Using this hub, I downloaded and aggregated DPSCD data on [Student Attendance](https://danieldistler-1.github.io/Distler-portfolio/DPSCD%20Attendance%20Data%202015-2019.csv), and [College Enrollment](https://danieldistler-1.github.io/Distler-portfolio/DPSCD%20Attendance%20Data%202015-2019.csv). These hyperlinks go directly to the aggregated csv files that I will use for this assignment.
