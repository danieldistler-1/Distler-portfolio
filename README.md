# Distler-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me 
My name is Daniel Distler and I am a first year [MSPPM-Data Analytics Student] (https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/public-policy-management-master/data-analytics) at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I am originally from outside of Boston, Massachusetts and I use he/him/his pronouns. As an undergraduate, I studied Public Policy and Business at the University of Michigan. After graduating, I joined Teach for America and spent two years teaching 6th Grade English and Social Studies in Detroit, Michigan. As a teacher, I became fascinated with the power of data analysis to improve the performance of myself and my students. I came to Heinz to further these develop these technical skills in order to improve my ability to make an impact.

# What I hope to learn 
In this course, I hope to practice my skills as a visual communicator. I want to learn to communicate findings in simple and effective graphics and practice my ability to generate informative visualizations. Additionally, I hope this course will provide me with some initial exposure to powerful visualization tools that I can use both as a student and a professional. Following completion of my graduate degree, I hope to work as a Data Scientist and leverage the technical and communication skills I have learned here at Heinz to solve fascinating problems, in either the public or private sector. While foundational technical skills are obviously important for solving these sorts of problems, I know as a professional effectively communicating one's findings is as important, if not more important, than generating the data analysis. I hope this course will sharpen my ability to communicate such finidngs through creative and informative visualizations.
